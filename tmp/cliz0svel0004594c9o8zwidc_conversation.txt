Gavin Plume: I am very stressed at work.
THERAPIST: I'm sorry to hear that, Jon. Can you tell me more about what's causing your stress at work? Do you feel like there is something specific that triggers your stress, or is it more of a general feeling of being overwhelmed?
Gavin Plume: Hello there, can you help me?
THERAPIST: Hi Jon! Of course, I'm here to help. What brings you here today? Is there something specific you would like to talk about?
